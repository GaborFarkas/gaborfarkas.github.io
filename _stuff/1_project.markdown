> Create powerful applications with the most robust open source web mapping library using this advanced guide

says the subtitle. It was a great time working on my first book. A huge project for me, a than novice author, written only two theses up until then. Frankly, it was a hell of a ride in which I got a lot of experience about writing, a solid material for my future courses, and of course my language also developed a lot.

The result is a book with a guide for creating advanced web mapping applications by building a very basic, budget Web GIS from scratch with OpenLayers. Feel free to explore the subjects of the book below. If you would like to read more, and would like to pay for it, you can order it from Packt or Amazon. If not, but you still need the book, well Iâ€™m not a big fan of piracy, but I understand.
