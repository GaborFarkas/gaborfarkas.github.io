Practical GIS is my second (and for now final) book for Packt Publishing in a much greater field. I used my writing experience from my previous book, my teaching experience so far, and what I learned in the past years to produce a practical guide for beginner GIS users preferably with some IT background. While I do not feel myself ready for an academic textbook, creating a technical guide with practical problems and solutions was clearly felt doable. I carefully chose software with which I had the best experience regarding learning curve besides productivity, the most essential theoretical concepts in order to understand the basics of GIS, and the most exciting tasks I met with in my career to create this book. I really hope it will reach its target audience and its readers will find it useful.

The book can be ordered from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-GIS-Gabor-Farkas/dp/1787123324/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511181195&sr=8-1&keywords=practical+gis) and [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/practical-gis).

The great thing about this work is Packt deemed it worthy to create a video course from it. They decided to break it in two separate video courses, from where the first one, [Practical GIS - Fundamentals of Open Source GIS](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/practical-gis-fundamentals-open-source-gis-video) is available. There are also two freely available parts showing raster handing and vector styling on YouTube:
