      <h2><a class="post-title" href="/blog/2014/getting-started-openlayers/">Getting started with OpenLayers</a></h2>
      <p class="post-meta">October 26, 2014 — 00:00</p>
      <p>In the world of open source web mapping interfaces, the biggest and most robust one is OpenLayers. OpenLayers was first released in 2006 by MetaCarta Labs. After 2007, it became an OSGeo project maintained by the OpenLayers Developer Team. It is still under development in these days. The two well-known and widely used branches of this project are OpenLayers 2 and OpenLayers 3. The third version was officially released this year (August, 2014.), and OpenLayers 3.1 has been announced. This also means, that OpenLayers 2 got out of development and the current version is its final form. OpenLayers 3 on the other hand is under constant development, so applications written with it may require frequent maintenance. In return we will get an interface armed with the capability of using up-to-date formats (e.g. TopoJSON), having beautifully rendered maps (WebGL) or in the future providing 3D maps (based on Cesium).</p>

      <p>When you start to develop your web GIS application, the first consideration will be the the interface you wish to work with. There is a wide range of open source GUIs. There are a lot of similarities in them, like they are written in JavaScript (the library which you will use to publish your maps if not the whole software), they use similar sets of values, they use similar methods to reach servers or handle geospatial data. There are lot of comparisons between various GUIs, but in reality there isn't such a thing like best and worst interfaces. Well, maybe there are worse ones, but I won't write about all of them. I will show some of the most popular ones, without attempting to be comprehensive. This post will be a prelude to using these interfaces, showing general considerations and methods to use them.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-title" href="/blog/2014/map-server-basics/">Map server basics</a></h2>
      <p class="post-meta">September 14, 2014 — 00:00</p>
      <p>If you would like to build your own map server, you have to think it through carefully first. Do you need a complete map server or you can stack with an existing one? Is Google Maps good for you or you need more control on your maps? There are several options on the internet and with some of them, you just have to write a brief JavaScript code and voilà, you have a well-visualized map. In the next few articles I will show some options which won't need an independent map server, but learning at least one of them will be inevitable if you have to build one.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-title" href="/blog/2014/apache-optimize/">Apache optimization for a map server</a></h2>
      <p class="post-meta">March 17, 2014 — 00:00</p>
      <p>The previous article covered most of the basics installing a simple Apache web server. With a working web server setup, you can make more specific considerations for a map server. There are simpler cases, like what kind of content you would like to serve or what kind of scripts and programs you will need. If you don't want an audiovisual wonder with something like flash, then the content mostly will consist of images and plain text. On the scripting side you will surely need JavaScript and Python. You may use some kind of shellscript on your way to build a map server, but you don't have to put any extra effort in optimizing that part. A bit more complicated list of considerations are, how to optimize the web server itself. You have to choose and set up the best MPM, set up privileges to various directories, choose the modules you have to use and throw away the unwanted ones, all in all, fine-tune the whole system.</p>
