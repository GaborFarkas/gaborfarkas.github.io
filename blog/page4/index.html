      <p>In these days programming skills became one of the most useful and well payed skills in the labor market. People working in the area know, that learning some popular programming languages can ease your life. You will benefit from it in your work, but you can make some of your everyday task easier, too. For example when you have a bunch of digital music albums in FLAC format and the name of the tracks are Track1, Track2, and so on, you can spend half of your day renaming them one at a time or you can just write a little script to do it for you in a few seconds.
There are a vast amount of programming languages out there. Some of them are specialized, good or just lucky enough to get in the spotlight. There are useful programming languages for writing binary or script codes, developing websites, learning the basics, and there are the languages written just for fun. They are typically useless, harder to program with and are messing with your brain, but they have one common feature: they are fun to program with. I've bumped into one of these languages recently: the ArnoldC.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-title" href="/blog/2014/apache-create/">Creating an Apache web server</a></h2>
      <p class="post-meta">March 3, 2014 — 00:00</p>
      <p>Now that you have a working Linux distribution on a server computer it's time to initialize a web server framework. The Apache 2 is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol web server program. It is highly optimizable and modular. This article will help you through the installation process of Apache 2.2 on Debian 7 and Apache 2.4 on Fedora 20. The default layout and command usage in those distributions are slightly different. In the first place I will show some general configuration options, then I'll continue with the distribution specific installation process. Note that some dissimilarities come from the different distributions, but some of them are simply because version version differences.</p>

      <p class="post-meta">February 27, 2014 — 00:00</p>
      <p> When you have a server machine and plan to run a dedicated Linux server, you should make some partitioning considerations first. For a mapserver you won't have to make a very detailed partitioning scheme, but you may consider to build some partitions for the basic functions of your Linux server. If you have to deal with RAID disks or GPT partitioning then I assume you already know how to structure your server. The following thoughts will be about a normal sized mapserver.</p>

      <h2><a class="post-title" href="/blog/2014/introduction/">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p class="post-meta">February 23, 2014 — 00:00</p>
      <p>Welcome to my web mapping tutorial. In this blog I will build various web mapping schemes on Linux systems. I chose two distributions: Debian and Fedora. This blog will cover the steps of making a working environment for web based WMS and WFS services without attempting to be comprehensive. I am doing this for a study, which of course has a deadline. If I will have some time left on my hands, then I will write about WPS based on GRASS. There will be posts about PostgreSQL and PostGIS, MapServer, GeoServer, Mapnik, Tilemill, OpenLayers, GeoExt, Leaflet and if time permits, Geomajas and tile caching softwares. There will be maximum two posts a week beginning with a partitioning scheme and Apache configuration.</p>
