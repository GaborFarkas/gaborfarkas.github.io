  <article class="post-content">
    <p>In these days programming skills became one of the most useful and well payed skills in the labor market. People working in the area know, that learning some popular programming languages can ease your life. You will benefit from it in your work, but you can make some of your everyday task easier, too. For example when you have a bunch of digital music albums in FLAC format and the name of the tracks are Track1, Track2, and so on, you can spend half of your day renaming them one at a time or you can just write a little script to do it for you in a few seconds.</p>

<p>There are a vast amount of programming languages out there. Some of them are specialized, good or just lucky enough to get in the spotlight. There are useful programming languages for writing binary or script codes, developing websites, learning the basics, and there are the languages written just for fun. They are typically useless, harder to program with and are messing with your brain, but they have one common feature: they are fun to program with. I’ve bumped into one of these languages recently: the ArnoldC.</p>

<p>ArnoldC is a parsing library written in Scala. It is a simple translator which compiles basic syntaxes into Java code. The twist is that these syntaxes are famous quotes from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Lauri Hartikka wrote this library and on his page the following can be read about his motivation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the one-liners of Arnold Schwarzenegger are fairly well known the true semantics of the uttering is yet to be understood. This project tries to discover new meanings from the Arnold movies with the means of computer science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ArnoldC language takes only basic systaxes, whereof most of them can be found in the C language, creating an imperative and semantically raw language. However you can type in famous one-liners of Arnold Schwarzenegger and they make a working program, which is very fun. You can download the ArnoldC Java library with the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">wget http://lhartikk.github.io/ArnoldC.jar</code> ran from terminal.</p>

<p>It’s so simple, the most basic programming examples are defined in hundreds of lines. You have to declare every function, since the ArnoldC can only understand the plus, minus, multiplication, division, greater than, and and or operators. I tried to program a solution for a very simple problem: calculate the perimeter and the area of a triangle based on the length of its sides.</p>

<p>The first problem is, that with keywords as long as these, it is very easy to make grammatical mistakes. To avoid such annoying problems, I like to use gedit with its built-in language recognition and highlighting. The only problem is, that it doesn’t have a vocabulary for ArnoldC (why would it have?). To overcome this problem, I quickly edited the <code class="highlighter-rouge">c.lang</code> xml vocabulary to recognize this language. You can download it here. You have to copy it in the <strong>/usr/share/gtksourceview-currentversion/language-specs</strong> directory. The “currentversion” for me is 3.0.</p>

<p>With this language extension, I could concentrate on the semantics. I planned a very simple structure, it starts with the length of the sides (yes, there isn’t a read function in the current version), checks if the triangle is valid (the sum of every two sides must be greater than the third side), then calculates the perimeter and the area. However, it came to light in an early stage, that besides the checking and the calculating functions, I have to define a square root function, too. Now there comes an other annoying feature of this language: you can only declare integer and boolean variables. So the square root function will only calculate an approximate value. I don’t want to write down every step in making the final code, see the result for yourself.</p>

<p>There were one last thing that didn’t let me rest. To run a code from a <strong>.arnoldc</strong> file, you have to compile it first then run it from a Java environment. After these steps, the compiled .<strong>class</strong> file will remain on your computer, so you have to remove it manually. Maybe it only disturbs me, but I wrote a script that can handle this procedure with one command line. For instructions of its usage, please <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> a terminal to the script and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">./arnoldc.sh -u</code>. Note that you can only run the script if it has executable permission. You can download the script from <a href="https://gaborfarkas.github.io/blog/2014/arnoldc/">here</a>.</p>

<p>As a conclusion ArnoldC is a very exciting experiment. It’s in an early stage (version 0.1) and I’m looking forward to future implementations of various C like syntaxes. It’s simple, it’s slow, it’s hard to master and it is very annoying. On the other side, you can get an insight into the most basic functions you’re using in your codes everyday. It is a great way to practice and understand and if you didn’t notice it yet: you can program with Arnold Schwarzenegger quotes. I can only encourage everyone who like programming to give it a try.</p>
