            extend your company with an IT-focused branch (e.g. a SaaS product), but you don't know how, I can lend you
            my experience. Let's be realistic: this is a niche service with few opportunities, but this is where I value
            myself the best. I can assemble the pieces for a basic scalable service portfolio, which can be extended
            dynamically by either your team or any software development company. This is not a software development
            counseling service. This is a complete package of software architecture, development, infrastructure,
            building a team of developers, mentoring, and project management techniques.</p>

                <p prompt>We have some initial meetings, where you introduce me to your goals, current plans, your

                    situation.</p>
                <div text>
                    <p class="pb-4">During this phase, we will create a working frame together. We need to establish
                        what
                        you plan to achieve, the key points in your company's life, and where you need my help. We will
                        estimate a realistic time frame, and a starting software complexity, then plan an organic growth
                        track.</p>
                    <p>We will talk about topics like:</p>

                <div text>
                    <p class="pb-4">I start this phase by preparing decision support documents, where necessary. You
                        should
                        be able to correctly assess the ramifications of choosing a technology stack over a different
                        one
                        and make the right decisions. After we settle on the languages, the frameworks, and the
                        architecture, I create the initial overview plan documentation using C4.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">We decide on the collaborative platforms we would like to use for sharing plans and
                        other software documentation in this phase as well. This system can be anything from a
                        well-established cloud provider to a locally hosted version control system. It will most likely
                        change further into the scaling process.</p>

                <p prompt>I develop the system-critical custom components.</p>
                <div text>
                    <p class="pb-4">Reinventing the wheel is bad for business. During the planning phase, we specify
                        components we should take off the shelf as a paid service or an open-source production-ready
                        solution. We also identify every component that should be hand-crafted for your system. From
                        these
                        components, system-critical ones are developed by me, to ensure a quality, consistent,
                        maintainable
                        backbone.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">Parallel to these developments, we start outlining the infrastructure for the
                        production
                        version of the system. We start using version control, CI/CD, and agile project management
                        methods.
                        This is also a great starting point for building up a team of developers through less critical
                        and
                        complicated custom components.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">We evaluate the complexity of the overall system together according to the planned
                        growth track. If you would like to build a team of junior and medior developers, we start with
                        less
                        complexity and help them into your company's life step by step through mentoring. If you would
                        outsource maintenance and further development to a professional company, we start with a
                        sophisticated and more complex stack.</p>

                <div text>
                    <p class="pb-4">Stable and scalable production systems are not the privilege of large multinational
                        IT
                        companies, although they need experience, knowledge, and much care to work correctly. An
                        efficient
                        infrastructure is essential for any production system, so the next step is to plan, install, and
                        configure the necessary software and write some automatization workflows.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">In this phase, we set up the required servers for the system to work. We make
                        decisions
                        on the granularity of the system, like how many stages the software should have (e.g. nightly,
                        staging, production). I can configure some Linux servers (if some components do not require
                        otherwise) with the necessary software, workflows, and automatization scripts.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">While every step of my service includes a strong DevSecOps line, I'm not afraid to
                        tell
                        you, that infrastructure is not my strongest suit. If your system needs much more than simple
                        containerization, Linux servers, and bash scripts, this is the point where we need to look for a
                        DevOps expert to complement my skills.</p>

                <p prompt>I closely monitor your progress but give you gradually more space to make technical decisions
                    without my advice.</p>
                <div text>
                    <p class="pb-4">Albeit the final, this is the lengthiest phase of our collaboration. At this point,
                        every cornerstone of the system is set and working, and we are only polishing and extending it.
                        Judging from your technical decisions and assessments, I keep some distance from steering and
                        management duties and concentrate on tasks you deem more important for your business.</p>
                    <p class="pb-4">Software development gets more concentrated from this point. I fix all the bugs we
                        can
                        find in custom-written components, and we gradually introduce the future maintainers and
                        developers
                        of the system to all parts. Mentoring continues for junior and medior colleagues if required.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-4">The end of this phase, coincident with the end of our long-term partnership, is
                        agreed
                        on mutually but mainly defined by you. When you feel confident in the future of your system,
                        your
                        technical preparedness, and your team, you are free and welcome to say goodbye and reduce our

            I'm
            only comfortable starting them when we have known each other for some time and figured out that we can work
            together efficiently, and have common goals and similar mindsets. If you are considering this package,
            please
            start with small-scale projects or counsels to confirm if we can work together for years.</p>

            As
            I don't have special legal obligations to any third party, it is your task to phrase the initial framework
            contract. Please keep in mind that I normally don't sign anything limiting my freedom, such as exclusivity
            contracts. On the other hand, I'm happy to sign any non-disclosure agreement. I'm also open to helping you
            phrase certificates of completion or other documentation you or your company needs.</p>

            can
            track every detail of the completed work through Clockify shared reports anytime. The monthly time budget is
            agreed on previously, so you can easily plan with my costs. Since long-term partnerships are unique,
            prices are calculated and tailored for each of them exclusively.</p>

        <p class="md:text-lg pb-12 px-6 md:px-0">For a successful partnership, it is essential to understand each other
            without language barriers. This field of work assumes high responsibility, making important decisions and
            handling sensitive information (e.g. company secrets), and therefore, requires high language proficiency. We
            both need to understand not only the gist of communication but also the nuances. For this reason, I only
            accept
            partners fluent in English or Hungarian.</p>
