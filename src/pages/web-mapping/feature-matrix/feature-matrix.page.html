        <p class="mt-16 pb-6">Back in my research days, one of my main interests was creating a cloud GIS, like Google and Microsoft did with Office applications. Usually, when you are planning such an ambitious project, you start with a thorough assessment. You need to know where the technology currently stands, whether there are available building blocks and the key missing points you should focus on. This endeavor started the same, with a feature support matrix listing GIS capabilities I saw as crucial for building a capable cloud GIS.</p>

        <p class="pb-6">The core concept of that research topic aged badly. The world does not need a cloud GIS. At least not yet. We need modular, feature-packed, cloud-compatible spatial libraries for making any application spatially aware without overhead. On the other hand, the feature comparison still makes sense. Developers work with web maps frequently, while deciding which web mapping library suits the application at hand is a tough choice. However, the better we can itemize the features needed, the easier that decision becomes, given that we have an up-to-date feature support matrix.</p>
