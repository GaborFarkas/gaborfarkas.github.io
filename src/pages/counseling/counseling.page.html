                I'm
                not considering myself a senior software architect yet. However, this is the field where most of my
                daily
                work pivots around, and therefore, experience builds up rapidly. In this field, I can help you with:</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">Web development</h1>
            <p class="pb-6">As my oldest skill, my seniority in software development is deeply rooted in web
                development.
                Specialized in front-end, I learned coding and software design through JavaScript. Extended with large
                amounts of server-side knowledge, modern design patterns, and frameworks (e.g. Laravel, .NET MVC,
                Angular,
                Vue), I'm still waiting for a problem I cannot solve in this field. Some highlighted technologies I'm
                highly
                qualified in:</p>

                <li>Web mapping (OpenLayers, MapLibre GL JS, Leaflet, Cesium JS).</li>
                <li>Front-end frameworks (Angular, Vue, Webpack).</li>
                <li>Creating modern, modular JavaScript/TypeScript libraries.</li>
                <li>PHP frameworks (UserSpice, Laravel).</li>
                <li>C# in general, but from a web perspective .NET MVC, especially Web APIs.</li>
                <li>eCommerce, many years of hands-on experience with nopCommerce (core, themes, plugins).</li>
                <li>Data (and 3D) visualization (SVG, D3, THREE, WebGL).</li>

            <h1 class="text-center">UI/UX</h1>
            <p class="pb-6">I like to create clean and intuitive user interfaces. While not a creative myself, I have
                plenty
                of experience working with custom designs and UI templates. In my opinion, the secret of designing great
                user interfaces and giving the best user experience is knowing your audience and therefore, having a
                basic
                but firm understanding of the human psyche. This knowledge is dangerous though, as the more you
                understand,
                the more damage you can do without noticing. Therefore, my most important rule in UI/UX design is:
                always
                satisfy and never exploit.</p>
            <p class="pb-6">I usually move on the Bootstrap - Tailwind axis when creating web interfaces. If there are
                no
                design plans available, I like to customize Bootstrap UI elements. If there are design plans or more
                complicated ideas, I usually stick with Tailwind. Also, I'm looking forward to trying Web Awesome for
                template UIs. In this area, I can help you with:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-12">

            <h1 class="text-center">Infrastructure</h1>
            <p class="pb-6">Infrastructure is not my strongest suit. Not because I'm bad at it, I'm only not so
                interested
                in it. I got introduced to it through the stereotypic setup; there are no system administrators
                available,
                let the software developer take care of everything. I did, and I learned a lot about administering Linux
                systems on the way.</p>
            <p class="pb-6">Lately, I'm more focused on the DevSecOps aspect of this area, especially on facets close to
                the
                architecture and development process, such as web security, CI/CD, automated testing, or
                containerization.
                While my experience in infrastructure is typically used for complementing other areas of expertise, if
                you

            <h1 class="text-center">Project management</h1>
            <p class="pb-6">I really like Agile. I like how early it recognized the importance of breaking up with
                traitional business-to-customer behavior in software development in favor of a client-centric one.
                Shortly
                after it came out, the Agile principles spread like wildfire. The IT industry showed how much it
                anticipated
                this change. What I especially like in this story is the lesson in it. It taught us, that money people,
                no
                matter how trained they are in economics, cannot control every aspect of every business. IT project
                management should be done with an IT background.</p>
            <p class="pb-6">While project management is not something I would like to ever do full-time, I find value
                and
                satisfaction in teaching how to use version control properly with git. This not only includes proper
                collaboration techniques (like rebasing) but also using git-flow, semantic versioning, and creating a
                maintainable product lifecycle. In this area, I can help you with the following:</p>
