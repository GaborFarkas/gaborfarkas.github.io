    <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl">Spatially enabled</h1>
    <p class="md:text-lg xl:text-xl pb-4">Have you thought about how much more we are relying on digital maps and navigation systems over the past few decades? With the world-breaking advent of digitalization and informatics ceasing into basic literacy in business and everyday life, new trends are emerging. As spatial algorithms and systems becoming more common, our location awareness is also firmly increasing. Spatiality is slowly becoming an essential part of decision making and business intelligence.</p>
    <p class="md:text-lg xl:text-xl">Having a PhD done around Web-based GIS (Geographic Information System), having spatial problems won't cause any roadblocks. From creating traditional GIS models to planning complete Web GIS solutions, I'm capable and happy to help.</p>

<div class="hero-section w-full my-10 text-center md:text-left" [background]="'assets/bg-science.jpg'">
    <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl">Based in science</h1>
    <p class="md:text-lg xl:text-xl">What my research days really taught me is every complicated problem has a unique optimal solution. While optimal is usually unfeasible to pursue in business scenarios, it is always good to try and approximate with critical thinking and holistic evaluation. Computer science students usually ask me what good can a MSc in geography do to you; well, for example, the ability to think critically and evaluate problems with a holistic view.</p>
    <ul class="md:text-lg xl:text-xl list-disc ps-8">
        <li>It's no use to swing around with patterns and methods just to look smart (even with Scrum... especially with Scrum). Always understand the problem and its context first.</li>
        <li>Modern problems are usually too complicated for pure solutions. Don't be afraid to apply hybrid ones even by mixing patterns from different disciplines.</li>
        <li>Always try to look at the full picture. Sometimes it's better to start with a less complicated stack than making a fresh team choke on quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl">Love to share</h1>
    <p class="md:text-lg xl:text-xl pb-4">With a teaching history of almost a decade mostly pivoting around teaching cutting-edge software development and architecture to international computer science bachelor candidates, quality mentoring is always in the picture.</p>
    <p class="md:text-lg xl:text-xl">Finding teching methods providing the best value in such a practice-oriented fast evolving field is a big challenge. My teaching habits both in and out of the university are based on experience rather than textbooks. Material is created and adjusted on the go, and tries to encompass both most recent trends and my most recent experience in patterns and best practices.</p>
