Rendering,,,,,,Raw data visualization features required for quality map composition,
Hardware acceleration,Rendering,3,2,1,1,The library can utilize the GPU for faster rendering,"OpenLayers’ support is partial, lines and polygons need additional setup. In Cesium and Maplibre, everything is hardware-accelerated. For Leaflet, you can try Leaflet.glify."
Render geometry,Rendering,1,1,1,1,The library can render vector geometries,
Render raster,Rendering,2,1,4,4,The library can render raster layers,Leaflet can render GeoTIFFs easily with the leaflet-geotiff plugin.

On the fly transformation,Pre-process,4,4,4,1,The library is capable to project vector data on the fly,OpenLayers and Leaflet must transform vector features to the map projection in order to display.

Spatial indexing,Pre-process,2,1,1,1,The library is capable to apply a spatial index on its internal vector layers to speed up processing and display,Leaflet can use the Leaflet.LayerIndex plugin for this.

In Maplibre GL JS, the base map usually consists of many layers."
Typed layers,Manipulation,1,1,1,1,The library has a type system for its layers,"Maplibre GL JS uses enums, the other libraries use classes and inheritance. Cesium calls its vector layers data sources."

Projection,,,,,,Projection handling,
Transform vector,Projection,1,1,4,4,The library can transform geometries between known projections,"Maplibre GL JS can convert between WGS84 and Web Mercator internally, but does not expose related functionality and does not support other projections. Cesium only supports WGS84 for vectors."
Warp raster,Projection,4,1,4,1,The library can transform raster and image layers between known projections,"OpenLayers cannot yet warp GeoTIFF rasters, but it can warp any image layer. Cesium’s support only covers Web Mercator image tiles."
